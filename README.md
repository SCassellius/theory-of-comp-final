## Firstly, A litter to the professor:
Dear Professor,

Here we are at the end of the semester. This year has been a personal hell for me. We already talked earlier in the semester so I will spare you most the the details. I really appreciated your kindness throughout the semester and I thought you made a great professor. From talking to my friends who have had you in they past, they loved you too. Overall, that made me feel even worse for struggling in your class when I knew you would be so able to help, but I just couldn't ask. I was able to see a psychiatrist, and unfortunately it made things a lot worse at first. I am only now starting to get a little bit better. I know I have a bad grade in your class, and a lot of work missing, and that nothing is going to make those assignment magically appear. However I want you to know that I was able to pay attention and try to get things done a lot better after our meeting earlier this semester, even if I don't have much to show for it. Most importantly though, I put why whole heart in this final project to give you a really quality piece of work that is worth a great grade and I hope it will convince you to pass me with a D. 

I talked to Dr. Toal earlier in the semester and I know this class isn't available next semester and so theres no way I can take it in the spring. It's also an upper division course, so I cant take it anywhere other than LMU. You would know more about this than me, but during one of his classes Dr. Toal said that this class was getting combined into compilers and another class to make two 4 unit classes instead of one 3 unit Theory of Computation class, so I might not even be able to take it at LMU at all. Unfortunately, these thoughts also only made it more difficult to try to get a handle on things. If there is theory next year, I still would not be able to take the spring semester because I need at least a D in theory to go into compilers, and without being able to do that I wouldn't be a full time student and I would lose my scholarships. I would have to take another leave of absence just to take theory next fall and then my course load for what would have been spring 2021, in spring 2022 making my stay in college 6 years long. I can't afford that financially, among so many other reasons. But enough whining. I know these aren't your problems. I am just praying that this project is worthy of passing me with a D, and I believe it is. Regardless, I wanted to thank you for your positivity throughout the semester and may this awful year be over soon. I just want to move on and focus on becoming mentally and physically healthier and graduating college. Next semester my medications should have normalized and I can start over on a healthy routine and focus on my talk therapy sessions when I feel myself slipping.

I know I wasn't able to meet with you, but I have done quiz corrections for quiz 2 (DFA minimization), and I have included those corrections in this repo. I hope that the success of this project is enough for you to evaluate my understanding and count those corrections toward my grade.

Lastly, I hope you and your family, friends, and relatives have an amazing Christmas. May God bless you.

Sincerely,

-Seth Cassellius
